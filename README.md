# PPGB-MS2

PPGB-MS2 is a tool for predicting the MS/MS of small molecules.

A comparison was made between PPGB-MS2 and two commonly used high-performance secondary mass spectrometry prediction tools, namely 3DMolMS and CFM-ID. The following is the relevant introduction of 3DMolMS and CFM-ID.

## [3DMolMS](https://github.com/JosieHong/3DMolMS)

**3D** **Mol**ecular Network for **M**ass **S**pectra Prediction (3DMolMS) is a deep neural network model to predict the MS/MS spectra of compounds from their 3D conformations. This model's molecular representation, learned through MS/MS prediction tasks, can be further applied to enhance performance in other molecular-related tasks, such as predicting retention times (RT) and collision cross sections (CCS).

## [CFM-ID](https://cfmid.wishartlab.com/)

CFM-ID is a widely used high-performance secondary mass spectrometry prediction tool. It also has a web server available for use. Currently, it has been updated to version 4.0. CFM-ID 4.0 incorporates a more robust machine learning process that utilizes a novel tensor representation to describe the topology of chemical structures. It also adopts a new approach for dealing with ring cleavage and new rule-based methods, which improve the MS/MS spectral prediction for specific classes of chemicals where the machine-learned model performs poorly.
